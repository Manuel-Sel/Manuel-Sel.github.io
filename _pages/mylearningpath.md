# Level 1: How I got hyped in 2019:

I got hyped on data science in 2019 watching the following video. Channel: media.ccc.de:

However, I didnt have the time and the motivation to start just yet.

# Level 2: Starting with the basics:

Staying home during COVID-19 virus and of course YouTube algorithms made me stumble over data science again. So after browsing YouTube a bit I stumbled upon a massive 6 hour video, explaining the basics of data science. Long story short, I watched it.
